## About
FTC Core is a multipurpose library that allows both beginner and advanced FTC teams to design advanced teleop and autonomous systems in under 100, very, very, simple lines of code. Inspired from libraries like FTCLib and Roadrunner, we wanted to develop a library that integrated extensive navigation and localization systems while providing plenty of space for teams to extend as much functionality as they need to execute their strategies. 


## Installation
Below is a detailed guide which describes how to install FTC Core into your project.
